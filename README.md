# SPA Problem

## Tasks
- Create SPA with js - es5, es6 +. Topic: component based app that allow you to mark current time and view past marks(Possible list of components: clock component, button that adds new mark(exact time info), list that contains all the marks, mark record)
- Make application accessable through web: heroku, github pages, etc
- Share your app link

## Optional
- Create express simples server for storing and getting markers
- If possible, try avoid react, angular, vue etc. Build it with plain js
- Recreate react appliation architecture. You can skip optimization issues
